# Description
Provides HW API framework for ATSAMD21G18A MCU generated by ASF4 using Atmel Start project used as static library. Application interface can be found in `board/hal/hal.h` file, which should be also the only file included in user application.
# Building
Note: when used as submodule in user application, the application itself should take care of library building.

Get repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Sabolik/feather_m0_lora_driver
```
and build directly from `feather_m0_lora_driver` directory:
```
$ make
```
Resulting `build/libfeather_m0_lora_driver.a` static library.
# Usage
Include `libfeather_m0_lora_driver.a` to your project and reference to `board/hal/hal.h` API from application code.
